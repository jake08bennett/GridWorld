Do You Know?

1)The bug does not always move to a new location, sometimes he simply turns the way he is facing. Such as at a corner or next to a rock

2)The direction the bug moves is the first available direction forward. This can be any way depending on if there is an open grid there. 

3)If the bug does not move it just stays in the same place without any change.

4)When it moves it leaves behind a flower.

5)When the bug is at the edge of the gird it turns clockwise until it finds a direction with nothing in the grid. It then moves there.

6)If there is a rock directly in front of the bug it will turn clockwise till it finds a grid with nothing in it then move to it.

7)Flowers do not move

8)Flowers have the color of the bug that runs over it eventually it fades out after a set period.

9)A rock has no other behavior other than not letting the bug or flower use that square.

10)No only one singular actor can be in a square.
